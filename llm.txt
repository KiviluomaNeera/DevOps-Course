The help of ChatGPT was used while doing this exercise. I wanted to use it as I thought it would provide quick help to my problems. I'm also very beginner
with these topics implementation wise so ChatGPT made it a lot easier to understand what all kinds of things the exercise would require and how to implement them.

ChatGPT helped to get quite quickly started with the exercise. I got good idea what for example the nginx configuration file should include and what other things 
needed to be to get it running. It also helped me to solve errors and give possible fixes to them.

ChatGPT got some configurations wrong at first or didn't take everything into consideration. For example it almost always forgot to add the requirement that the service1
needed to wait 2 seconds between requests.
